Prompt 1
Generate a complete, minimal modern React 18+ frontend (Vite base) for a public geo-photo density map viewer. No auth or login—purely read-only, fetches data from a FastAPI backend on Cloud Run. Use Leaflet.js (OSM tiles), Leaflet.heat (weighted heatmap), custom thumbnail markers, and react-modal for full-image views. Style responsively with Tailwind CSS (modern, clean: full-screen map, subtle legend for categories 1-4, header/footer). Deploy as static site container to Cloud Run (Dockerfile for built app served via nginx).
Backend Capabilities (FastAPI on Cloud Run):

Public GET /points?lat1={sw_lat}&lng1={sw_lng}&lat2={ne_lat}&lng2={ne_lng}: Returns JSON array [{id, image_url, location: {lat, lng}, weight (0.25-1.0), category (1-4), timestamp}]. Uses PostGIS for efficient bounds queries.
Auth-protected endpoints exist (e.g., POST /upload for logged-in users via gAuth; GET /my-uploads), but frontend ignores them—public read-only only.

Frontend Features:

Map: Leaflet base (OSM); heatmap with weights (blue-low to red-high gradient); markers as thumbnails (from image_url)—click opens modal (full img + category/weight/timestamp).
Logic: Fetch on mount/zoom/pan (debounce 500ms); default center on user geolocation (browser API); loading spinner/errors.
Env: REACT_APP_API_URL (e.g., https://backend-url.run.app).
Structure: src/App.jsx (main), src/MapView.jsx (Leaflet setup), src/ImageModal.jsx, src/usePoints.js (fetch hook). package.json (deps: react, leaflet, leaflet.heat, react-modal, tailwindcss). Dockerfile: Build Vite, serve /dist via nginx. .env.example, README (npm i/start/build; gcloud run deploy --static).
